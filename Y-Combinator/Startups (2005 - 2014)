Our customers can now focus on customer relationships, inventory, and building their core business rather than worrying about hiring drivers, planning routes, and other delivery logistics.","Logistics, Shipping, Postal and Courier Services, Enterprise Software","Divya Bhat, Gautam Jayaraman",2014,Winter,Y Combinator,,,San Francisco,California,USA,https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/202846-e11d1cce051ad34d442d90d83526b3b1-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1372100735,http://www.seed-db.com/companies/view?companyid=5757552776183808,https://angel.co/rickshaw,
